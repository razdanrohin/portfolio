<p>In this project, the accelerator and the LEDs were peripherals that shared the same I2C bus for communication. The Accelerator movement in x-y-z directions lit rgb respectively.</p>

<p>Initially the code used Busy-Wait for the accelerator which prevents the CPU from doing other tasks, thus the efficiency of operation is compromised initially.Initial code uses Busy-Wait which prevents the CPU from doing other tasks, thus the efficiency of operation is compromised initially.
Why dit we use RTOS?</p>

<ul>
  <li>RTOS uses more memory</li>
  <li>We may need a lightweight implementation</li>
  <li>This could be transferred to a cheaper board</li>
  <li>May need to add other parts of code in</li>
  <li>RTOS may delay response, But this may not matter based on human eye
How did we fix it: Compare performance between Blocking and FSM</li>
  <li>First: Mode 1 - blocking (checking initial responsiveness, with Busy-Wait)</li>
  <li>Set debug bits and connect logic analyzers to collect data on runtime of each task.</li>
  <li>Second: Mode 2 - FSM w/ run-to-completion scheduler (Without any Busy-Wait OR RTOS)</li>
  <li>Write/configure a FSM mode</li>
  <li>Create CFG of task to plan FSM conversion</li>
  <li>Configure tasks to run periodically</li>
  <li>Create Handshake w/ I2C Msg: (init g_I2C_Msg.Status = IDLE)</li>
  <li>if Status is IDLE return unless Command is READ or WRITE.</li>
  <li>Update Status to READING or WRITING if needed.</li>
  <li>Begin I2C &amp; begin FSM.</li>
  <li>Update Status to READ_COMPLETE or WRITE_COMPLETE</li>
</ul>

<p>FSM Implementation</p>
<ul>
  <li>Breaks down the TMS into small pieces that can communicate within each other using the shared data structure (g_I2C_Msg). In Busy wait we have to run unnecessary functionality too. But in an FSM functionality which requires the processor is given the priority.</li>
</ul>
