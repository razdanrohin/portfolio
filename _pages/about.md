Hey!

Thanks for visiting my blog! 

I’m **Rohin**, presently a graduate student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at North Carolina State University. I am currently a research assistant under Dr. Amro Awad working with Sandia National Labs, structural simulation toolkit development team. I completed my undergraduate studies from the University of Mumbai, India, majoring in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering. I started this website to help me document my work and share the wonderful things that I have learnt so that others will be able to benefit from my work.

My interests lie with working on embedded systems and learning ways to improve the system on chip architectures. As a child, I would spend hours taking things apart, wondering how they work and then putting them back together, though sometimes that did not work. This spurred my interest in hardware engineering and contributing to the  devices that can help reduce human effort and make human machine interaction rather less of a chore.

I also consider myself a musician who loves to produce and sing for personal harmony. I always try to learn some new riffs or chords, as they help me with memorizing and associating concepts, while I practice guitar and think!

When I’m not at work or in school, I can be found either wandering near lakes/trails or in a music store.

For those who are interested, here is my resume with some projects I was involved in through my graduate coursework: [resume](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11xV7tnra9QUOOrdAAJlCvjKIDM_P17kFQPaVnOdN_IY/edit?usp=sharing).

I am available on LinkedIn. Click [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rohin-razdan/).

I’ve some code hosted here on [github](https://github.com/razdanrohin). I have some projects in private, though their description is available in my blog! If you would like to know more, you can always [email](mailto:rrazdan2@ncsu.edu) me!
